This release focuses on the new Momentum application introduced in 2025 and includes an overall layout simplification with clearer access to primary actions, making your schedules easier to interact with.

**Instant Analytics** are now available directly on all schedules removing the need to export data or to create custom reports. A new **Timeline view** has been added, specifically designed for high-volume schedules where visibility into coverage density matters. 

Momentum Classic remains available as the default when you login. You can access the new version from the top menu in _**Scheduling** → **View schedule** → **Date View (new)**_.

## ✨ UI and usability enhancements

- **Dark mode**: Choose between light, dark or let the UI follow your system preference.
- **Quick-search**: instantly highlights assignments on screen as you type.
- **Fast Assignment creation**: Right-click any cell in the schedule to create a new assignment. Assignment fields are now automatically pre-filled based on context and active filters (date, role, staff, location).
- **Row/Column Multi-Select**: Select entire rows or columns of assignments for faster bulk editing.
- **Multi-Select**: Publish or unpublish assignments individually or in bulk.
- **Shift View**: new layout options for alternative schedule visualization.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: faster navigation and actions for power-users, for example:<br>
    • `N` to create an assignment<br>
    • `F` to edit filters<br>
    • `Ctrl + K` to quick-search (`⌘ + K` on Mac)
