Scheduling medical teams is a significant challenge for healthcare organizations. The demands of on-call shifts, the unique requirements of each specialty, and unexpected changes make the task highly complex, especially when available tools don’t fully meet real-world needs. The result? Substantial cost implications, dissatisfied teams, and, at times, compromised care quality. 

At BioSked, we decided to take on this challenge. With the revamped Momentum, our medical team scheduling solution, we provide healthcare professionals with a simpler, faster, and more efficient way to organize their work. 

## Optimize Your Workflow: Schedule Management Up to 10 Times Faster 

The new date-based view redefines the user’s experience with a clean, functional interface. Designed to reduce clicks and streamline workflows, it allows administrators to complete tasks up to 10 times faster, cutting scheduling administration time by up to 80%. This means precious time saved, which can be reinvested in higher-value activities, directly improving care quality. 

“We regularly meet with our clients to observe their real-world needs and discuss how they use our tools. These direct insights help us improve our products and adjust our roadmap in real time. At the same time, we leverage thousands of years’ worth of scheduling data to refine our engine through artificial intelligence. This unique blend of on-the-ground proximity and cutting-edge technology enables us to deliver an unmatched scheduling solution,” highlights Alex KERPELMAN, Software Developer.
