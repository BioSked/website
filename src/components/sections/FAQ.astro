    question: 'How is pricing calculated?',
    answer:
      'Per active user per month. A user is anyone who builds schedules OR gets scheduled.',
  },
  {
    id: 'upgrade-later',
    question: 'Can we start small and scale up?',
    answer:
      'Yes. Upgrade or downgrade anytime. Mix plans across departments (e.g., Starter for admin staff, Plus for clinical teams).'
  },
  {
    id: 'compliance',
    question: 'Is this compliant with healthcare regulations?',
    answer:
      'Yes. We\'re fully HIPAA and GDPR compliant. We only store scheduling data, not PHI.',
  },
  {
    id: 'implementation',
    question: "What's included in implementation?",
    answer:
    "All plans include onboarding and configuration support. Pro and Enterprise include dedicated project management and custom rule setup."
  },
  {
    id: 'control',
    question: 'Do we lose control over our schedules?',
    answer:
      'No. Momentum automates the repetitive work (pattern generation, conflict checking, fairness tracking) but you maintain full control over rules, exceptions, and final approval. Think of it as an intelligent assistant, not a replacement.',
  },
  {
    id: 'time-reinvestment',
    question: 'What do teams do with the time they save?',
    answer:
      'Most scheduling teams reinvest saved time into strategic workforce planning, staff development, credentialing support, and proactive problem-solving. Momentum makes your team more effective, not smaller.',
  },
