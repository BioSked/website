Designed for all types of healthcare facilities, regardless of specialty, Momentum is the intelligent scheduling solution built to optimize rosters, enhance real-time visibility, and streamline service coordination. Intuitive and powerful, it adapts to the needs of over 30,000 daily users across more than 1,000 healthcare facilities in 9 countries.

Whether it’s a public hospital, an imaging center, or a surgical unit, day-to-day operations rely on shift-based organization:
☀️ Morning – 🌤 Afternoon – 🌙 Evening/Night.

To better support frontline teams, Momentum now introduces **a new shift-based schedule view**, directly aligned with the daily rhythms of care facilities.

*“We are very satisfied, this is exactly what we were waiting for. It gives us better visibility and significantly reduces errors from manual changes. The process is much faster, and the sidebar display of assignment settings when clicking on a cell is a real bonus. The planning remains very clear and easy to read.”*<br>— Axelle Braun, Radiology Planning Administrator at CHU Brugmann

## A More Intuitive View, Built for Everyday Hospital Use
No more hard-to-read linear schedules during peak activity. With this update, teams gain instant access to a clear and structured view:

- Which radiologist is on duty this morning?
- Who’s taking over in the OR this afternoon?
- Which resources will be in recovery tomorrow morning?

This new feature improves schedule readability, enhances team coordination, and reduces the risk of errors or overlaps.
