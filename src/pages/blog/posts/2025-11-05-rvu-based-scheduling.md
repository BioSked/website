Radiology has evolved — but scheduling hasn’t kept up.

As imaging volumes grow and teleradiology networks expand across regions, many departments still rely on templates and spreadsheets built for a different era. The result: inefficiency, fatigue, and an uneven distribution of work.

**Modern imaging performance is measured in Relative Value Units (RVUs)**, not hours. Coverage now spans states, countries, and continents, not corridors. Yet most scheduling systems are stuck in manual spreadsheet chaos.

## A New Model for How Radiology Teams Work

At RSNA 2025, BioSked will unveil how its AI-driven platform Momentum becomes the first solution built around RVU-based scheduling and multi-time-zone coordination, giving radiology leaders an entirely new way to manage productivity and coverage.

RVU-Based Planning: Assign radiologists by workload capacity and subspecialty, aligning staffing with real clinical demand.
Multi-Time-Zone Orchestration: Coordinate distributed teams seamlessly across regions, for uninterrupted 24/7 coverage.
AI-Driven Fairness and Agility: Cut up to 90 % of administrative effort while maintaining transparency and equity across teams.
Already trusted by over 1,000 healthcare sites worldwide, Momentum transforms scheduling from a manual chore into a strategic advantage for imaging organizations of every size.

## Why It Matters
Radiology leaders face rising case volumes, workforce shortages, burnouts, and the growing complexity of hybrid and remote work.
Momentum brings operational balance: matching the right expertise to the right workload, wherever teams are located.

“Scheduling shouldn’t be an afterthought. It’s the operational backbone of how care gets delivered.”
— David Dudok de Wit, CEO, BioSked
