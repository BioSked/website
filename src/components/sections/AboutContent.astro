        Healthcare scheduling is complex—multi-site coverage, rotation fairness, compliance rules, shift preferences, RVU balancing. We built Momentum to handle that complexity automatically, so scheduling teams can focus on strategic workforce planning and physicians can focus on patients.

        Most scheduling software just digitizes your spreadsheet. Momentum thinks for you.

      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Our rules-based automation builds schedules automatically—whether you're a solo physician managing your own rotations or a workforce director coordinating across multiple hospitals. You define the rules once (shift patterns, fairness policies, compliance requirements), and Momentum handles the complexity from there.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        The result? Fair schedules, fewer disputes, and time back for what matters—patient care, strategic planning, or simply going home on time.
