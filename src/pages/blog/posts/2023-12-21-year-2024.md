**Why manually scheduling your healthcare staff should be left in 2023.**

It is no secret that scheduling healthcare staff across professions, departments and locations can not only be difficult, but immensely time consuming. The amount of time a healthcare organization spends on manually scheduling staff can vary widely depending on the size of the organization, the complexity of scheduling requirements, and the efficiency of the manual processes in place. Generally, manual scheduling is a dreaded task, and the larger the organization, the more challenging and time-intensive it becomes.

In healthcare settings, where 24/7 coverage is often necessary, and staff may work various shifts, including nights and weekends, creating an optimal schedule can be a complex task. Factors that contribute to the time spent on manual scheduling include:

- **Staff Size:** The more employees there are to schedule, the more time-consuming the process becomes.
- **Shift Complexity:** If the organization has multiple shifts, part-time and full-time staff, and varying skill sets, creating a schedule manually becomes more intricate.
- **Staff Preferences and Constraints:** Taking into account individual staff preferences, availability, and any scheduling constraints adds another layer of complexity.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Ensuring compliance with labor laws, union agreements, and other regulatory requirements adds time to the scheduling process.
- **Changes and Adjustments:** The need to accommodate last-minute changes, swap shifts, or address unexpected absences can increase the time spent on scheduling.
- **Communication:** Coordinating with staff to communicate schedules and address any concerns or conflicts can be time-consuming.
- **Record Keeping:** Manual record-keeping of schedules, time-off requests, and other relevant information can add to the workload.

While managing staff schedules manually may seem like the more cost-effective option. However, manually scheduling employees can have various internal financial implications, some of which include:

### Labor Costs and Inefficiencies:

Overtime Costs: Manual scheduling may lead to suboptimal allocation of staff, resulting in overtime expenses as employees may need to cover shifts unexpectedly.

Understaffing and Overstaffing: Poor scheduling may lead to either understaffing (compromising patient care) or overstaffing (increasing labor costs unnecessarily).

### Productivity Loss:
Time-Consuming Process: Manual scheduling is time-consuming, and the more time spent on scheduling, the less time staff can dedicate to direct patient care or other productive tasks.

### Human Errors:
Mistakes in Scheduling: Manual scheduling increases the risk of errors such as double-booking, assigning the wrong staff to a particular shift, or overlooking required certifications or qualifications.

### Compliance Risks:
Regulatory Compliance Issues: Failure to comply with labor laws and regulations related to working hours, breaks, and overtime can result in penalties and legal issues.

### Employee Morale and Turnover:
Burnout and Dissatisfaction: Inefficient scheduling may contribute to burnout and dissatisfaction among healthcare workers, potentially leading to increased turnover. High turnover can incur additional recruitment and training costs. For more information on this matter, check out our post, The Rising Costs of Job Vacancies and Turnover in Healthcare Organizations

### Patient Care Quality:
Impact on Patient Care: Inadequate staffing levels due to manual scheduling may compromise the quality of patient care and overall patient satisfaction.

### Data-Driven Decision-Making:
Lack of Data-Driven Insights: Manual scheduling may hinder the organization’s ability to collect and analyze data related to workforce management, which can be crucial for making informed decisions and optimizing staffing levels.

### Flexibility Challenges:
Difficulty in Adaptation: Manual scheduling might make it challenging to adapt quickly to changes in patient volume, staff availability, or other unforeseen circumstances.

To mitigate these financial implications, many healthcare organizations are adopting automated scheduling systems that leverage data analytics and artificial intelligence to optimize workforce management, reduce errors, and enhance overall efficiency. The upfront costs may initially seem like a lot, but in nearly every single case, the cost will be outweighed by the long-term efficiency gains.
